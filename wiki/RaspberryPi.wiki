#summary Controlling your EZ Robot from Raspberry Pi

= Introduction =

I suggest using ArchLinux from www.raspberrypi.org/downloads as it has the drivers for the wireless cam that comes with the EZ-Robot kit already installed

Update the system with
{{{
pacman -Syu
}}}

install bluetooth, svn
{{{
pacman -S bluez svn
}}}

pair with the EZ Robot as per instructions [http://code.google.com/p/ez-openbot/wiki/LinuxBluetoothPairing here]

Checkout the code
{{{
svn checkout http://ez-openbot.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ez-openbot
}}}

and compile as per instructions [http://code.google.com/p/ez-openbot/wiki/CompilingTheLibrary here]
